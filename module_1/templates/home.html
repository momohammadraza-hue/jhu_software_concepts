      <h1>Mohammad</h1>
      <h2>Senior Technical Program Manager</h2>
      <p>
        Living in Seattle, as a TPM I help drive large-scale datacenter and GPU deployment programs with a focus on
        solving tough challenges, simplifying processes, and delivering results.
        I love innovating and building solutions to all types of problems.
        My wife and I love cooking, boating, and driving in the mountains while learning as much as we can!
