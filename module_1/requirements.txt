JHU Modern Software Concepts — Module 1: Personal Website
Author: Mohammad Raza  

What this is  
- A simple Flask app for my personal site (Module 1).  
- Three pages: Home, Projects, Contact. Minimal and clean.  

What you need  
- Python 3.10+  
- Flask (install from requirements.txt)  
- Virtual environment recommended  

How to run it  
1) cd module_1  
2) python3 -m venv .venv  
3) source .venv/bin/activate   (Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1)  
4) pip install -r requirements.txt  
5) python3 run.py  

Where it runs  
- http://localhost:8080  
- Bound to 0.0.0.0:8080 (per assignment)  

Pages  
- `/` → Home (name, role, short bio)  
- `/projects` → Module overview + GitHub link  
- `/contact` → Email + LinkedIn  

Structure  
- run.py → app entry point  
- /templates → HTML templates  
- /static → CSS + images  

Challenges & Learnings  
- Mac setup issues — ran into errors with xcrun and mismatched architecture. Fixed it by reinstalling Apple Command Line Tools and making sure the environment was arm64-native.  
- GitHub repo structure — Git ignores empty folders, so I added a placeholder (.gitkeep) to commit module_1 properly.  
- Flask environment — got "module not found: flask" errors when running outside the venv. Solved by always activating .venv first.  
- Templates — Flask couldn’t find pages until the files had the .html extension. Renaming them fixed the issue.  

That’s it—quick, simple, and ready to go.
